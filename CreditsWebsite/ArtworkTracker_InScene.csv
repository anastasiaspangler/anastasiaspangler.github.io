Picture,Psyche Vision,Images/ModularLab/PsycheVision,Modular Lab,2D,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/galleries/artwork/,J Meyer,Jan 27th 2023,Biology & Spanish,Digital Painting / Procreate," This piece, which I’ve titled “Psyche Vision,” represents the drive and motivation being put into the Psyche mission, and keeping our eyes set on the ultimate goal. To represent this, I drew a human eye, using the color palette of the Psyche mission, and in the eye’s reflection the Psyche asteroid and orbiter are visible. I wanted to emphasize the connection between humans and our instinctive curiosity and drive, which is why I placed the asteroid in the position of the eye’s pupil. To create this piece, I used the Procreate application, where I drew a rough sketch of my composition. I then blocked out the parts that would be in shadow and the parts the would be in light. I wanted the right side of the image, the side to which the pupil is looking, to be illuminated with light to show how Psyche is a source of inspiration and motivation. I used the appropriate Psyche mission colors for the light and shadow, and finished the piece by adding highlights along various portions of the skin and the eye/asteroid."
Picture,Heart of Gold,Images/ModularLab/HeartOfGold,Modular Lab,Skybox,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/galleries/artwork/page/3/,S Hollasch,November 09 2020,Industrial Design,Digital Illustration ,"The Psyche asteroid is hypothesized to be the remains of a protoplanet formed in the early solar system that underwent collisions that shed it of its outer layers, leaving exposed core material behind. The Psyche asteroid was named after the titular figure in Greek mythology – the goddess of the soul. I was inspired by the name and the story of the asteroid’s creation – the idea that Psyche is the exposed heart of a long-vanished planet. This illustration shows the luminous metal core just after the moment of impact, when its light first breaks through a cloud of debris"
Picture,Birth of Psyche,Images/ModularLab/BirthOfPsyche,Modular Lab,2D,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/galleries/artwork/page/13/,A Thornhill,December 15th 2020,Graphic Information Technology,Adobe Illustrator ,"My digital work Birth of Psyche is a vector image I made in Adobe Illustrator. I was inspired by the insight studying Psyche will give us into our own planet. We are getting a deeper understanding of how planets form. I wanted to represent the birth of Psyche and this knew found knowledge through light, which appears through the collision of the two asteroids. Psyche was the goddess of the soul as well, so I wanted to represent her as a spirit by making her more opaque"
Picture,Psyche's Core,Images/ModularLab/PsychesCore,Modular Lab,2D,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/galleries/artwork/page/22/,S Tennant,March 18th 2025,Illustration and Creative Writing,Digital Collage,"After learning about the Psyche Mission team’s desire to make their work’s collaborative nature more publicly known, I knew that would be the basis for my next project. I made and sent a questionnaire to the Psyche Mission team and my fellow interns, where they gave me their reasons as to why they think the Psyche Mission is important. By using the responses of others involved with Psyche to inform my art, I was able to introduce a collaborative element to my artwork, which would reflect the collaboration that occurs among scientists and the Psyche Mission team. Their responses largely involved a yearning for discovery and exploration and how Psyche’s similarities to Earth’s core could help further our understanding of our own planet. I hoped to capture these sentiments in my art through the use of color and symbolism."

Here’s to the Psyche Team and their incredible spirit and wisdom.
Picture,The Arrival,Images/ModularLab/TheArrival,Modular Lab,2D,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/galleries/artwork/page/13/,S Angel Pitts,April 4th 2024,Illustration,Digital Illustration ,"Inspired by space movie posters, “The Arrival” pictures the eventual meeting of the Psyche asteroid and the spacecraft."
Picture,Trans World Airlines,Images/ModularLab/TransWorldAirlines,Modular Lab,2D,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/galleries/artwork/page/14/,C Ponce,April 17th 2023,Biological Engineering,Photography/Graphic Design,"In a search for inspiration, I ended up at Surplus Sid’s Military Surplus Shack in Carrboro, NC. Initially reluctant to join me, my friends were worried about the characters that would populate a run-down military surplus store in the South. We ended up being the only people in the store, other than Surplus Sid. He was a kind, tall man with a long, white beard who followed me around to explain items around the shop. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw schematics for the SR-71 on his wall. I asked if he was a fan of aerospace engineering, and he replied yes. He explained to me that when he was my age, he made a list of 108 things that he wanted to do before he died. The 108th thing was walking on the hills of the Moon. He never got to do that, but he explained he was able to come close, seeing the glow of our atmosphere from the edge of space. Above the documents, there was a picture of a much younger man in what looked like a space suit. Sid explained that he worked in military intelligence, and was friends with a pilot of one of only a few SR-71 planes with a co-pilot seat. We continued to talk and I explained my interest and space and work with Psyche Inspired, asking if there were any old magazines he had. He found some LIFE magazines published as far back as the 40s. I rushed home to read the magazines, finding a TWA ad that I immediately was inspired by. I decided to recreate the ad with my friend, Tanner, before realizing it would be great for the Psyche Inspired program."
Picture,The Pieces of Psyche,Images/ModularLab/ThePiecesOfPsyche,Modular Lab,2D,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/galleries/artwork/page/13/,I Garcia,December 15th 2025,Art and Design,"Digital Painting, Procreate, Adobe Photoshop","This work, “The Pieces of Psyche,” is a digital poster that illustrates the key instruments that will be used to scan the Psyche asteroid. These include the magnetometer, multispectral imager, and gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer. While there are other instruments on the craft, these three are the main ones that will be used to analyze the asteroid. The three figures surround the main craft and are illustrated at the same size as the craft in order to visualize everything better. Each part has a short and clear description of what it is made to do when it reaches its destination and the information it will gather from the asteroid. They are also labeled as to where on the craft they are located. The purpose of this is to be an entry-way to the Psyche mission for those who just want a quick introduction to the project. Since many NASA and JPL missions have a lot of information to learn about, I wanted to make a poster that condenses the data in order for an audience to be intrigued rather than overwhelmed. I feel that there are two purposes to this piece: One is to introduce the mission so that an individual will be excited to research more about Psyche. The other is if someone only wants a quick overview of a portion of what the Psyche mission is about. As someone who lives at the intersection between the art and science worlds, I have seen both sides of the spectrum stray away from each other when they do not see an overlap between their studies. I want to use this project as a building block for understanding scientific topics in a visual form."
Picture,Sippin' On Psyche,Images/ModularLab/SippinOnPsyche,Modular Lab,3D-AI,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/galleries/artwork/page/13/,E Stabilito,January 23rd 2023,Bussines (Sustainability),Acrylic paint on ceramic mug,"This is a ceramic mug depicting Psyche asteroid and orbiter in space. Subtle stars represent imagination while two firey columns depict the thrill and nature of discovery. There is an illuminating quality to the world of science and exploration. Against a dark, unknown backdrop, the bright yellow, pink, and orange (Psyche logo) colored columns channel this energy of discovery and illuminate both the asteroid and orbiter in their wake; one product of human innovation, the other of the universe itself."
Picture,How Big Is 16 Psyche?,Images/ModularLab/HowBigIs16Psyche,Modular Lab,2D,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/galleries/artwork/page/13/,G Marshall Wolff,June 6 2022,Physics,Infographic/Digital/Illustrator and Photoshop,"This project is meant to give a more vivid idea of how large the (16) Psyche asteroid is in comparison to things people actually have experience with. Although size comparisons on larger scales are useful, it can be difficult to grasp the size of something extremely large when comparing it to something else extremely large. However, we also had to ensure we didn’t spread a misconception that the asteroid was going to hit Earth. So, although a view of the asteroid in a perspective from Earth was exciting, it was also terrifying. For this route, we decided to use the view of New York City and Hawaii from space, images that people are familiar with and can potentially relate to real-life experiences of seeing them from planes. The mass and density of the asteroid were also helpful in providing a more physical connection. Finally, adding in a portion that shows how we know the size of Psyche was included to help it feel more real and concrete."
Picture,The Formation of Psyche,Images/ModularLab/TheFormationOfPsyche,Modular Lab,2D,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/gallery/the-formation-of-psyche/,B Young,November 17th 2020,Graphic Design,"Digital Illustration, Created in Illustrator and Photoshop","For this project, I created a book of eight postage stamps. These stamps illustrate how Psyche may have come to be, in eight different phases. I wanted to use postage stamps because they are tiny, but a necessary part of mail circulation. Using postage stamps will help express that Psyche is far away and tiny on a planetary scale, but is an important step towards the future of space exploration. The border of the upper right hand corner of an envelope around the stamps can also symbolize Psyche’s potential remanent magnetic field. Furthermore, postage stamps have a designated price. Because Psyche was the 16th asteroid discovered, the stamps are worth 16 cents, and the numbers on the bar code illustrate the start and end dates of this flight mission by month and year. I do not digitally illustrate often, so I was excited to experiment with a new medium. To accomplish this project, I started off by researching different U.S. postage stamps and their sizes. Once I found the exact size, I sketched out my illustrations in my notebook. I was then able to digitally create sketches in Adobe Illustrator and bring them to life on postage stamps and envelopes in Adobe Photoshop."
Picture,Psyche 2026,Images/ModularLab/Psyche2026,Modular Lab,2D,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/gallery/psyche-2026/,Riley Perry,January 26th 2026,Communication Design and Envionmental Biology ,Graphic Design,"Psyche 2026 is a Psyche mission wall calendar designed to transform an often overlooked everyday object into a source of inspiration. While the Psyche mission spans many years, there are countless meaningful moments, not only from Psyche, but also from space science more broadly, that deserve to be remembered and revisited. My hope is that these highlights spark curiosity and motivate a sense of wonder throughout the year. The piece is intended for Psyche Mission staff, NASA fans, and all space enthusiasts! Aimed to be more visually engaging than logistically functional, Psyche 2026 showcases key mission milestones alongside significant dates in NASA’s exploration history. The numbers ‘2026’ at the top of the calendar were built using shapes from the Psyche mission logo. Each digit is composed of these elements, creating a piece that ties the year directly to the mission’s visual identity. Designed to hang at a desk workspace, the calendar serves not just as a practical tool, but as a daily reminder of why we explore, why we care about this work, and how past achievements continue to inspire us. 2026 is an especially exciting year for Psyche. In May, the spacecraft will perform a gravity-assist flyby of Mars, using the planet’s motion and gravity to increase speed and adjust its trajectory without significant propellant use. Psyche will coast with its thrusters off for precise navigation, pass about 1,900–2,700 miles above Mars, and then continue on a 29-month journey toward the asteroid. This is an event I was eager to highlight in my calendar."
Picture,Imagining Psyche Through Crochet,Images/ModularLab/ImaginingPsycheThroughCrochet,Modular Lab,3D-Scan,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/galleries/,C Geisler,January 17th 2025,Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering,Crochet/Amigurumi,"This project, entitled “Imagining Psyche through Crochet,” is a crochet interpretation of the Psyche asteroid and Psyche goddess. It’s my hope that this project will catch the eye of children, especially young girls, and help them learn about the Psyche mission, perhaps inspiring them to pursue a career in STEM. For my abstract model of the 16 Psyche asteroid, I followed the Full Moon Crochet Pattern by Etsy shop catsscrochet and put my own spin on it by choosing a gray and brown variegated yarn to reflect the metallic elements that make up Psyche. I also embroidered the craters using a mixture of red-brown and dark grey yarn to represent the unknown surface of the asteroid. For my crochet doll of the Psyche goddess, I primarily followed the Twinkle Faries Crochet Doll Pattern by Etsy shop PocketFullOPoseys, but I also incorporated parts of the Rapunzel and Pascal Crochet doll pattern by Etsy shop FennecToysUA to create her long, flowing curls. I used a purple variegated yarn for her dress and sparkling magenta safety eyes to reflect the colors of the Psyche mission patch. Special thanks to the pattern creators mentioned above and my grandma, who taught me to crochet."
Picture,Around Psyche Rug,Images/ModularLab/AroundPsycheRug,Modular Lab,3D-AI,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/galleries/artwork/page/14/,Z Gibson,April 20th 2022,Graphic Design,"Tufted Rug, Yarn and Fabric","The creation of the Around Psyche rug was a multi-step process. First, I began by creating a design with four rings of differing color and a shape for Psyche at the center. The rings represent the different orbits of the Psyche spacecraft from Orbit D on the outer edge of the design to Orbit A at the center around Psyche. Once the design was finalized with some embellishing details, including a star shape that is symbolic of the spacecraft, I projected and traced it onto a large piece of loose-knit fabric. Using a tufting gun, I punched different colored yarn through the fabric until my design was complete. Using carpet glue on the back and adding a plush backing fabric helped seal in the yarn and finish the rug. While the rings of color are proportionally spaced apart to reflect the orbit distances, I think the rug composition also lends itself to being a visualization of Psyche as a planetary core."
Picture,The Trials of Psyche,Images/ModularLab/TheTrialsOfPsyche,Modular Lab,3D-Scan,https://psyche.ssl.berkeley.edu/galleries/artwork/page/13/,A Miller,April 12th 2023,Architecture,"Epoxy Resin, Mica powder, and gold flakes cast in a silicone mold","‘The Trials of Psyche’ is a custom chess set inspired by the goddess Psyche’s story. Made from epoxy resin and mica dyes as well as gold flakes and glitter, this art piece embodies the life of Psyche from her mortal birth to her rebirth as a goddess. Like chess is played in turns, Psyche faced similar trials from the hands of Aphrodite. There are many ways to interpret chess as a metaphor for Psyche’s life. For example, each piece on the board is indicative of her journey; her husband Eros as the knight who saves her from the underworld, her own royal parents as the king and queen. The colors chosen in this project are inspired by the Psyche color palette as well as the struggle between Psyche and her enemies. This juxtaposition of light and dark, represented by the pink-gold and dark purple-silver pieces, is indicative of the struggle between good and evil forces in her life."

Laser Cut and Engraved Cast Acrylic, Paint Pens, Neodymium Magnets","When my family travels, we always bring back a magnet to remember our trip by. So, for my first project, I fabricated three magnets depicting the major stops on Psyche’s journey for us on Earth to remember it by! The first magnet shows Psyche blasting off from Earth aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, with the ocean and sky behind Kennedy Space Center visible in the background as the rocket passes above the clouds and into the stars, forming the “T” in “blast off.”"

Journeys into space are full of exciting and unknown possibilities that always defy our expectations, and I aimed to capture the scope of what our future images of Psyche might be. After modeling the skeleton shape of the asteroid, I used procedural noise algorithms to add displacement to the models, adding physical terrain variations. However, the largest portion of this project involved creating textures. By layering, blending, and mathematically compiling a wide range of noise algorithms, I was able to build a variety of textures for Psyche that had exciting and subtle variations in color, surface texture, roughness, bump, reflection, and metal-ness. The final component involved lighting each scene to reflect the massive scale of Psyche, despite its lonely nature out in space"

For this piece, I wanted to depict a story that would personify the Psyche spacecraft, getting people to sympathize with Psyche’s search for answers about our world. I was inspired by a lot of my other peer interns who approached their projects narratively! I loved the stories they had about their versions and interpretations of Psyche, so I wanted to try my hand at a creative approach— and what better way to do that than a mini booklet! I was also somewhat inspired by the Voyager Golden Record, since the “letter” is addressed to an entity we may never get a response from. I created this piece digitally in Procreate, predominantly using colors from the official Psyche brand and logo."
